# Fear Valley Server

[![code coverage](https://github.com/FearfulFlamingos/fear_valley_server/blob/master/docs/Report/badge_linecoverage.png)](https://fearfulflamingos.github.io/fear_valley_server/Report/index.html)

This is the server build for the game [Fear Valley](https://www.github.com/schuna05/senior_project). In order to play the game, you must download and run the server first. After that, two people on your local network will be able to play against each other.

## Installation

Both of the binaries for the client and the server are portable builds, meaning they can be run from anywhere on your computer (e.g. `C:\Games`). Simply unzip the folder wherever you would like and run the client and server to begin.
