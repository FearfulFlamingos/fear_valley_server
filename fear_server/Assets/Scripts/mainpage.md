# Fear Valley Client Documentation

Welcome to the main page! On the left hand sidebar, you'll find links to all of our classes and namespaces, each with detailed descriptions of what they do. To get started, select Classes and begin looking through our class list. 

You may notice some classes don't have a description of what they do while the interface version of the class is filled out. As indicated by the ```<inheritdoc>``` tag in the file itself, the documentation on the interface applies 1:1 with the class that inherits from it. In this case, it seems like Doxygen ignored that particular inheritance. If you open the solution up in Visual Studio or VS Code, you will see that the tooltip correctly inherits the comment.

Finally, it's worth noting that the Files tab does not link out to our files. In order to explore the code fully, please look through the appropriate repository.
